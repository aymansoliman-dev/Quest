## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
Each component follows a consistent pattern with:
- Constructor for initialization
- Render method returning DOM elements
- Event handling with proper binding
- Clean separation of concerns

### State Management
```javascript
// Example: QuizApp state management
constructor(questions) {
    this.questions = questions
    this.currentQuestionNumber = 1
    this.score = 0
    this.numberOfQuestions = questions.length
    this.questionTime = 30
}
```

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Proper focus management throughout the application
- Screen reader announcements for quiz progress
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast theme support

### Performance Optimizations
- Vanilla JavaScript for minimal bundle size
- Efficient DOM manipulation with minimal reflows
- CSS transitions for GPU-accelerated animations
- Optimized image assets and font loading

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Start Quiz**: Click "Start Quiz" to begin the interactive experience
2. **Answer Questions**: Select answers within the 30-second time limit
3. **Navigate**: Use the "Next Question" button to progress through the quiz
4. **View Results**: Review your performance with detailed answer breakdown
5. **Retake**: Option to retake the quiz for improved scores

## 🌐 Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome 80+
- ✅ Firefox 75+
- ✅ Safari 13+
- ✅ Edge 80+

## 🔧 Development

### Local Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd Quest

# Open in your preferred server (e.g., Live Server, Python HTTP server)
# For Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Development Workflow

**Smart CSS Loading:**
The application automatically detects and uses the best available CSS:
- **Development**: Uses `style-sheet.css` (19.1 KB) with comments for debugging
- **Production**: Uses `style-sheet.min.css` (11.1 KB) for optimal performance

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Development server
npm run dev              # Starts development server

# Production build
npm run build:css        # Creates minified CSS (42% smaller)
npm run build           # Full production build
```

### CSS Architecture

**Professional Single-File Approach:**
- **Size**: 19.1 KB (754 lines) - optimal for single-file architecture
- **Organization**: 15 logical sections with clear documentation
- **Performance**: Better than splitting at this size (1 request vs 3-5)
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth with excellent structure

### Recent Improvements

**🐛 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed double execution issues with timers and event handling
- Resolved score doubling bug caused by event bubbling
- Eliminated theme flash on page load (FOUC prevention)
- Fixed animation cleanup preventing elements from staying invisible

**✨ New Features:**
- Smooth page transitions with professional animations
- No-reload quiz retaking with complete state reset
- Smart CSS loading (automatically uses minified CSS when available)

- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**📊 Performance Improvements:**
- 42.3% CSS size reduction with minification
- Eliminated duplicate animations and improved timing
- Better memory management and resource cleanup
- Optimized DOM manipulation and event handling

### Adding Questions
Questions are stored in `questions.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Your question here?",
  "answers": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
  "correct_answer": "Correct option"
}
```
